        title: "Barbell Back Squat",
        level: "Compound",
        equipment: "Barbell",
        duration: "2:14",
        thumb: "SQ",
        mechanics: "In this video, we break down the Barbell Back Squat. We'll focus on the setup regarding bar placement (high bar vs low bar), the descent by breaking at the hips and knees simultaneously, and driving up through the mid-foot while maintaining a neutral spine.",
        proTip: "Don't rush the descent. Control the weight down, explore your depth, and drive up explosively. Keep your chest up and core braced throughout."

        title: "Romanian Deadlift",
        level: "Intermediate",
        equipment: "Barbell",
        duration: "1:45",
        thumb: "RDL",
        mechanics: "The RDL is a pure hip-hinge movement. We focus on pushing the hips back while keeping a slight bend in the knees. The bar should travel close to your legs, and the movement is reversed when your hips cannot travel back any further.",
        proTip: "Think 'hinge', not 'squat'. If you feel this in your lower back, you might be going too deep or losing your brace. Stop when your hamstrings are tight."

        duration: "3:10",
        thumb: "BSS",
        mechanics: "Focus on stability and unilateral strength. Place your rear foot on a bench, keep your torso slightly leaned forward to engage the glutes, or upright for quads. Descend until your back knee almost touches the ground.",
        proTip: "This is a balance challenge as much as a strength one. Pick a spot on the floor 5 feet in front of you and stare at it to help maintain stability."

        equipment: "Machine",
        duration: "1:20",
        thumb: "LP",
        mechanics: "A stable compound movement. Ensure your lower back stays glued to the pad throughout the rep. Lower the platform until your knees are roughly at 90 degrees, then drive partially out without locking your knees.",
        proTip: "Never lock your knees at the top of the movement. Keep constant tension on the quads by stopping just short of lockout."

        duration: "1:55",
        thumb: "GS",
        mechanics: "Hold the dumbbell vertically against your chest. This front-loaded position encourages an upright torso. Squat down between your legs, using your elbows to push your knees out at the bottom if needed.",
        proTip: "This is the best way to learn squat mechanics. If your heels come up, widen your stance slightly or work on ankle mobility."

        thumb: "PU",
        mechanics: "Initiate the movement by retracting your scapula (pulling shoulders down and back), then drive your elbows down to your pockets. clear the bar with your chin and lower under control.",
        proTip: "Imagine you are pulling your elbows into your back pockets. This mental cue helps engage the lats rather than just the biceps."

        mechanics: "Support yourself on a bench. Pull the dumbbell towards your hip, not your shoulder. Keep your elbow close to your body and squeeze the lat at the top.",
        proTip: "Don't rotate your torso to get the weight up. Keep your shoulders square to the ground to isolate the back muscles effectively."

        thumb: "LPD",
        mechanics: "Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Lean back slightly, drive shoulders down, and pull the bar to your upper chest. Control the ascent to stretch the lats.",
        proTip: "Use a 'thumbless' grip (thumbs over the bar) to reduce forearm involvement and put more focus on the back."

        mechanics: "Set the cable at eye level. Pull the rope towards your forehead, separating your hands and rotating your forearms back. This hits the rear delts and rotator cuff.",
        proTip: "This isn't a power move. Go light and focus on the external rotation at the end of the movement for shoulder health."

        proTip: "Leg drive is secret power. Push your feet into the floor to stabilize your body, but keep your glutes on the bench."

        mechanics: "Set bench to 30-45 degrees. Press dumbbells up and slightly in without clanking them. Lower until a stretch is felt in the upper pec.",
        proTip: "Don't set the bench too high (like 60 degrees) or you'll shift too much tension to the front delts instead of the upper chest."

        mechanics: "Hold dumbbells with neutral grip (palms facing each other). Curl weight up towards shoulder keeping elbows pinned to sides.",
